The file `cpu_probabilities.txt` contains a list of exponentiated outputs of the model during **testing**. Note, they are not the direct outputs of the model. Refer to the notebook, if in doubt or for manipulation.

`output_model_raw.txt` is the actual output from model.

The saved model from the notebook in this folder can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6SFqceZvOZrwHRPdJFVkOtjwS3ZM3LO/view?usp=sharing. One can load it (using eg: PyTorch) and use it directly for inference.
